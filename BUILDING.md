For the most part, Visual Studio (or the "dotnet" commandline tool) should be able to resolve the
project's dependencies automatically. GTK will also be installed as necessary, if on Windows.

You must also have "git" in your path for the build process to succeed (so that it can get the
version to be shown in LynnaLab's titlebar). On Windows you can download git from
[here](https://git-scm.com/download/win). (Ensure that the options you select will put git into your
PATH variable; this happens by default).
