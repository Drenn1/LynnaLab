- Features:
    - Ability to add areas, etc, as well as moving labels which refer to the same
      data
    - Select multiple tiles from a tileset at once
    - Rectangle select / fill
    - Provide an interface for editing "data/singleTileChanges.s"?
    - View and edit object animations

- Technicalities:
    - Treat no-value, 2-value, and quad-value interactions the same
    - Understand local labels
    - Deal with ConstantsMappings that don't have a mapping for a value
    - Figure out how to deal with hard-coded warp destinations:
        * Moblin's Keep
        * Interaction $1f
    - Update "data/gashaSpotRooms.s" as necessary?
    - Dungeon editing: can't add more than 4 floors?

- Objects:
    - Handle interactions referencing same data
    - Show the values from constants/interactions.s
    - Static dungeon objects
    - Show and edit object animations

- Tileset editing:
    - Collisions
    - Add/remove tilesets, deal with 00/0c using the same mapping/collision
      files

- Bugs:
    - Crash when changing animation index
    - Crash when area ID is too high

- Also needed for feature parity with ZOLE:
    - Probably will do these through disassembly:
        - Dungeon portal editing
        - Gale seed warp editing
        - Start editing
        - Dungeon essence teleport editing
        - Enemy editing

    - Palette editing
        - Smooth palette fades
    - Treetop editing

    - Provide info for asm hacks (remove beginning locks, etc)


Complete:
    - Dungeon minimap editing
        - Also change properties like how many floors
